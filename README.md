Hi There!

I'm Si√¥n, which is Welsh for Sean/Johannes/Ivan and I work as a cloud native engineer in the backend domain.

- I really enjoy working with the following technologies, and always keen to learn more in the cloud space whenever possible:
	- Python3.7+ :snake:
	- Golang
	- PostgreSQL
	- Serverless Functions
	- Azure
	- Docker
	- Kubernetes
	- Helm Charts

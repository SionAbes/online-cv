  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    Welsh born web-developer with a focus on Python based technologies. I'm
    always looking for new ways to improve my knowledge of all kinds of topics
    from Domain Driven Design, to better ways of collaborating such as 
    #NoEstimates and Kanban. Despite being an engineer at heart, I see myself
    evolving into a "Project-Engineer" role, enabling better integration
    between developers and project managers. As a naturally social person,
    I'm at my best within a motivated, cross-functional, collaborative team
    environment.
    
    I have a strong skill set in API design, container orchestration, and
    data ingestion pipelines. I love to work with Python3.10+, FastAPI,
    SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, PostgreSQL, TimeScaleDB, Docker, Helm, Kubernetes, 
    Kafka, and Flink.
    
    You will often see me between writing Notion pages, with my terminal 
    open firefighting, or constantly running tests in PyCharm doing TDD!

    company: Memfault, Berlin, Germany
    details: |
      Worked to create a Device Reliability Platform, which helped enable 
      hardware firms better monitor, update, and debug their devices. The 
      monorepo consisted of many moving parts from Linux, Android, and MCU 
      based SDKs, to a highly customised Flask API using SQLAlchemy and Celery. 
      During my time at Memfault, I helped deliver a bulk action mechanism 
      that allowed users to update vast fleets of devices with a click of a button.

    details: |
      First of 10 to be employed at Tacto, I worked as a Full-Stack Engineer, with
      a lean towards backend development! I helped enabled the platform built for 
      sustainable procurement, by migrating from Django and producing a FastAPI 
      backend designed with Domain Driven Design, Repository Pattern, Unit of Work
      Pattern, Authorization, Authentication, Dynamic Migrations with Alembic and
      auto-generated API specification for Frontend/Backend contracts!

      Successfully aquired by Gropyus GmbH in August 2021!
      
      Remote worker who refactored, and built up the deployment and operations 
      of the corrux platform. During my 6 months specialising in DevOps, I 
      rebuilt all our CICD pipelines into a best-in-class deployment system 
      using GitHub Actions and Helm. Alongside this, I help setup local dev 
      environments using a Helm Repository and KubeApps to enable developers 
      to pick-and-choose the microservices they wish to run in a local 
      environment.
      
      With help from the CTO, we re-imagined our QA system which led to a 
      dramatic decrease in the bugs detected in our production environment. I 
      also managed a crisis situation whereby an Azure Kubernetes bug took out 
      all container networking within our clusters. Due to the work on Helm 
      Charts, I successfully migrated over 15 microservices within 1 hour to a 
      fresh new cluster, which would have otherwise taken over a day with all 
      of the configurations.

  - role: Backend Engineer
    time: Feb 2020 - Jan 2021
    company: corrux GmbH, Munich, Germany
    details: |
      As a Backend Engineer I helped deliver machine-to-user pipelines to 
      facilitate effective usage of heavy industrial data. Being in the 
      forefront of cloud native innovation, I create solutions using 
      technologies such as Kubernetes, Azure, Python & Go to create fast, 
      resource efficient, and most importantly scalable to the needs of our 
      customers.
      
      As part of a team effort, self-organised a major architectural overhaul of 
      our backend to meet production standard scalable software. This involved 
      moving from container orchestration to a Azure based serverless 
      application, utilising Kafka messaging service, C#/Python Azure Functions 
      and switching from an outdated and bulky Flask API to Fast API. Was able 
      to provision over 1 billion datapoints in 24hours, and process them into 
      relevant timeseries tables.
      
      Combined with the tech aspects of my duties, I became the Agile Coach of 
      the team to support our CTOs new vision on way of working, and help 
      facilitate team alignment through the working methods of Agile.

      company: corrux GmbH, Munich, Germany
      details: |
        As a Backend Engineer I helped deliver machine-to-user pipelines to facilitate 
        effective usage of heavy industrial data. Being in the forefront of cloud native 
        innovation, I create solutions using technologies such as Kubernetes, Azure, Python 
        & Go to create fast, resource efficient, and most importantly scalable to the needs 
        of our customers.

        As part of a team effort, self-organised a major architectural overhaul of our backend 
        to meet production standard scalable software. This involved moving from container 
        orchestration to a Azure based serverless application, utilising Kafka messaging service, 
        C#/Python Azure Functions and switching from an outdated and bulky Flask API to Fast API. 
        Was able to provision over 1 billion datapoints in 24hours, and process them into relevant 
        timeseries tables.

        Combined with the tech aspects of my duties, I became the Agile Coach of the team to 
        support our CTOs new vision on way of working, and help facilitate team alignment through the 
        working methods of Agile.

        Moved from Data Technology into the newly formed AI Platform Services team in ProSiebenSat.1 
        Tech Solutions as a full Software Developer! Completely refactored our AI Platform Project, 
        from a legacy single code base, into a cloud distributed micro-service framework using Kubernetes, 
        GitLab, AWS, GCP and various third party machine learning frameworks.
    - role: Junior Software Developer

      company: ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE
      details: |
        As a Junior Software Developer in the Department of Data Technology, I contributed to the development 
        of backend related services for containerising machine learning sequences, working with Python3 and SQL. 
        I mainly worked with the systems administration of Linux based servers and worked alongside senior developers 
        on a cloud transformation project, which involved moving our internal systems to cloud platforms such as 
        Google Cloud Platform and AWS. Alongside this, I am worked extensively on developing a new workflow mechanism, 
        using a queuing system for ML services.

    intro: >
        I've mainly worked on backend oriented projects, but I'm really not afraid to get my hands a bit dirty on some legacy code!
        I thoroughly enjoy cloud transformation projects, and feel I excell with serverless or kubernetes!
